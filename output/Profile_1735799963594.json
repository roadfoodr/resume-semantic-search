My professional background includes wealth\nadvisory, institutional equity research, and private equity roles at\nother leading wealth management firms in New York City and Los\nAngeles. \nOne of the reasons I chose a career in the financial services\nindustry, is my desire to help others. This passion stems from\nwitnessing the challenges faced by people in my life and I\nrecognized the need for a caring professional to help others define\ntheir goals, establish a wealth management strategy centered\non their priorities, and help them adjust their strategy as needed\nwhen the inevitable changes in life happen.  As a financial advisor I\nfocus on working with women who run private businesses, medical\ndoctors, company executives, and retirees.\nOutside of the office, I enjoy traveling with my family, reading about\nmedieval history, and cooking, because it’s part science and part\nmagic. \nPlease visit http://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/us/en/legal for\nimportant disclosure information.
