With a solid technical\nbackground as a member of the Project Management Committee\n(PMC) and a committer for various Apache projects like Spark,\nYuiknorn, and SystemDS, I have the expertise to attract and recruit\ntop talents globally while fostering a strong engineering culture within\nmy teams. \nI have achieved notable accomplishments by building and leading\nmultiple teams at Apple, including those dedicated to Spark, Flink,\nand Data Security. The collective efforts of these teams were\nrecognized and honored with the prestigious ACM SIGMOD Systems\naward in both 2023 and 2022, marking two consecutive years of\nachievement. Many projects developed within my teams have also\nattained industry-standard status, enabling wider accessibility and\nutilization among diverse user communities. \nThrough my leadership and technical acumen, I have consistently\ndriven innovation, established high-performing teams, and\ncontributed to the advancement of the Apple Data Platform, resulting\nin accolades and the widespread adoption of our projects throughout\nApple and the industry.\nTalks: https://www.dbtsai.com/talks\nPublications: https://www.dbtsai.com/publications\nExperience\nDatabricks\nSenior Engineering Manager\nNovember 2024 - Present (3 months)\nMountain View, California, United States\n \nPage 1 of 4\n\n \n \nThe Apache Software Foundation\n9 years 8 months\nApache YuniKorn PMC member / Committer\nMarch 2019 - Present (5 years 11 months)\nApache Spark PMC Member / Committer\nJune 2015 - Present (9 years 8 months)\n– My contributions, https://github.com/apache/spark/commits/master?\nauthor=dbtsai\n– Designed and implemented L-BFGS, Multinomial / Binomial Logistic\nRegression in Spark, and several other features.\nApple\n6 years 7 months\nHead of Core Data Platform\nOctober 2023 - October 2024 (1 year 1 month)\nCupertino, California, United States\nI lead three teams at Apple: Spark, Flink, and Data Security, growing them\nfrom 2 to 25 members. It's an honor to lead these award-winning teams,\nrecognized with the ACM SIGMOD Award in 2022 and 2023, demonstrating\nour impactful work and leadership in the big data industry.\n1. Our Spark team at Apple is exceptionally strong, with several Spark\nPMC members and committers. Many members co-received the 2022 ACM\nSIGMOD System Award for their contributions to Apache Spark. We leverage\nour open-source influence to align developments with Apple's needs. The team\nhas open-sourced Apache DataFusion Comet, a Spark native accelerator\nthat accelerates data insights, improving business outcomes and significantly\nreducing compute expenses, saving millions each month for Apple.\n2. The Flink team at Apple includes several Flink PMC members and\ncommitters, with two co-receiving the 2023 ACM SIGMOD System Award\nfor their contributions to Apache Flink. They developed a new Java-based\nFlink operator tailored to Apple's unique use cases and open-sourced it under\nApache Flink. Recently, Google retired their Flink K8s operator and now\nrecommends ours. It's incredible to see our project's adoption beyond Apple.\n3. At Apple, safeguarding customer data is paramount. Our security team\ndeveloped Parquet Modular Encryption and Apache Iceberg Table Encryption,\nproviding scalable columnar data encryption compatible with query engines\n \nPage 2 of 4\n\n \n \nlike Spark, Trino, Flink, and Hive. This ensures the protection of vast amounts\nof sensitive data, spanning multiple petabytes.
