I have led teams to solve hard technical challenges in\ndistributed systems at the scale of hundreds of millions of users and\ncoached engineers and managers to help them grow and succeed. I\nthrive in high velocity environments, particularly relishing challenges\nwhere the industry standards and product  requirements evolve fast\n(such as Generative AI), and negotiations need to be done between\ndelivering near term business value and building a solid long term\nfoundation. I have also been used as a \"fixer\" multiple times (such\nas unblocking major backend migrations, turning deadlocks into\nproblem solving with appropriate tools including escalations).\nExperienced in working with non-engineering partners.\nExperience\nLinkedIn\n12 years 6 months\nPrincipal Staff Software Engineer\nJuly 2020 - Present (4 years 7 months)\nMountain View, California, United States\nOne of the tech leads for the company's AI Platform that supports 1000+ AI\nengineers. \n* Tech lead for the Generative AI / LLM capabilities in the AI Platform. In this\nrole, I partnered with the modeling teams to convince leadership to take a\nstrategic bet on fine-tuning open source models and together we were able to\nsatisfy the product needs at 75x cost efficiency compared to the original GPT-4\nmodel.\n* responsible for extracting the best unit economics out of a large chunk of\ncompany's GPU fleet,\n \nPage 1 of 5\n\n \n \n* influencing many strategic technical decisions around LLM and LPM\n(ranking / personalization) inference, model authoring frameworks, training &\nfine-tuning capabilities, ML Ops, hardware choices, genAI application stack\n* hiring and performance reviews\n* cross-company initiatives  \n* technical bets\nSenior Staff Software Engineer\nSeptember 2016 - July 2020 (3 years 11 months)\nMountain View, California\n1) Notifications Platform:\n- Started owning LinkedIn’s notifications ecosystem at a time of lack of\ntechnical vision, too many disconnected developments, high-touch onboarding,\nand low client satisfaction. \n- Over the last 3 years, my team has built a central notifications platform\nwhich supports offline/nearline/realtime use cases, configurability, ML models,\noperations (delivery time: hours -> seconds/minutes), increasingly self-\nserve UI-driven integration (onboarding time: months -> 2-4 weeks) & e2e\ndebugging.\n- Today, the platform / use cases are the *largest driver of user sessions* and\nsignificant contributors to other business metrics.\n- Likely one of the most advanced notifications platforms among companies\nthat depend on recommendations or network driven engagement.\n2) Marketing Technology: With increasing spend ($$$M/year), the goal was to\nenable internal marketers to seamlessly reach “the right audience in the right\nchannels at the right time with the right message” to maximize ROI & optimize\ntime to market. The team spanned Marketing Ops, Data Science, Analytics\nInfra, Enterprise Productivity, Consumer Eng. We put together a design and\na beta release to enable self-serve campaign creation, centralize data in a\ncustomer data platform (CDP), deliver across multiple channels, recommend /\nfilter using ML, by leveraging in-house & third party technology. \n3) Dynamic Configuration: Changing application behaviour using configs\ncan be calendar time consuming due to the number of repositories touched,\nmultiple service restarts, testing and repeating the whole cycle if bugs are\ndiscovered. The goal was to minimize this time by eliminating service restarts\n& providing easy config management. My team worked across orgs to define\na phased approach and delivered a dynamic config management experience\n \nPage 2 of 5\n\n \n \nnatively integrated with LinkedIn's experimentation engine, and onboarded\nmultiple clients.\nStaff Software Engineer\nJune 2015 - September 2016 (1 year 4 months)\nMountain View, California\n1) Realtime LinkedIn -> User device Push: Pub/sub and persistent connection\ninfrastructure that powers instant conversation-like experiences by low latency\ndelivery of events to connected apps and also doubles up to avoid capacity\noverload of polling. I led the design, implementation and rollout of the v1\nplatform functionalities and instant messaging features. The platform later\ncontinued to evolve to support Presence/Chat as a first class feature, and the\nevents traffic increased 10X with newer use cases and organic engagement.\n2) Messaging: Data organization, mid-tier, security, technical design reviews,\nfeature development, engineering practices. Co-led the core architecture re-\ndesign of LinkedIn's messaging platform with two other tech leads from ground\nup to replace the legacy stack, scale an order of magnitude. \nWorking in the Messaging org has been an exhilarating experience as the org\nscaled from 15 engineers to 55 within one year, much of the software was\nrefreshed, and a good amount of long-lasting leverage was created. The async\ndesign review process piloted by our team was later adopted by all product\nengineering orgs which amounted to ~1.5-2k engineers.\n3) Project Voyager: As a short term gig to help ship LinkedIn's new Flagship\napp, I led the Front-End API server side development of the 'Network Brief/\nRecommendations' features. This brief stint provided me a steep learning\ncurve in the FE world and consumer-facing product development.\n4) Site Speed: Worked to optimize site speed of various consumer product\nareas such as Growth, Identity, Feed, Messaging, Contacts/PYMK, Groups,\nPulse, etc. Drove large chunks of horizontal optimization efforts such as killing\nredirects, and contributed to tools for performance bottlenecks detection using\nreal user monitoring data.\nSenior Software Engineer\nJuly 2014 - June 2015 (1 year)\nMountain View, California\nFollowFeed - Distributed system to ingest and retrieve Feed index with support\nfor filtering, relevance and A/B testing. It replaced a SenseiDB based solution. \n \nPage 3 of 5\n\n \n \nFrom the project's conception, I worked on all aspects of FollowFeed v1.0 -\ncaching and persistence using using embedded KV store (RocksDB), data\ningestion and querying, integrating relevance and A/B testing, bootstrap,\noperationalizing and client onboarding, performance optimizations focused on\nGC/network/OS/request fanout for mitigating the 99th percentile and increasing\nQuality of Service. \nMajor accomplishments: 5X reduction in the 99th pct latency of serving\nfeed index, ability to handle 3X throughput compared to Sensei, 20X longer\nretention, 50% CapEx reduction.\nSoftware Engineer\nAugust 2012 - July 2014 (2 years)\nMountain View, California\nApache Kafka - Open Sourced distributed publish-subscribe system. Kafka\nis used by almost every service in production at LinkedIn, and also by many\nother companies. (kafka.apache.org).\nI contributed to the stabilization/operations of Kafka's replication features,\nwrote a hadoop job to push data from HDFS to Kafka with features such as\nevent count auditing, drove a backward incompatible client rollout with 80\nclients, solved some major pain points in tools and auto-deployments.\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nResearch Assistant\nAugust 2010 - May 2012 (1 year 10 months)\n- Worked with PGI and Cray accelerator compilers that can parallelize and\noffload compute intensive loops to GPUs with hints from programmer in the\nform of directives.\n- Demonstrated the abilities, or the lack thereof, of aforementioned compilers\nto automatically apply loop transformations to remove dependences between\nloop iterations, using a home-made microbenchmark suite.\n- Recommended a series of transformations to convert sequential programs to\na format compatible for compiling with the PGI and Cray accelerator compilers.\nDemonstrated their impact on CPU/GPU computation and communication, and\non overall performance.\n \nPage 4 of 5\n\n \n \nFacebook\nSoftware Engineering Intern\nMay 2011 - August 2011 (4 months)\nPalo Alto, CA\n- Designed a NUMA-aware request scheduler for HPHP (HipHop) and\nperformance optimizations.\n- A new scheduling and load balancing scheme that binds threads to NUMA\nnodes and prohibits memory sharing across threads running on different\nNUMA nodes.\n- The performance tests conducted on different types of machines with vanilla\nlinux kernel showed a reduction of 5-10% in cpu time required to satisfy a web\nrequest.\nTensilica\nIntern\nJanuary 2010 - June 2010 (6 months)\n- Rendering of image data using a master-slave hierarchy of TX\nmultiprocessors in parallel.\n- Implemented a few instructions of JVM on Xtensa Configurable processors.\nIndian Statistical Institute, Kolkata\nSummer Intern\nMay 2009 - July 2009 (3 months)\nI wrote algorithms for distributed computing by autonomous robots (denoted\nby points on 2D plane) using essential tools of maths and computational\ngeometry and optimized the time complexity.\nEducation\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nMS, Computer Science · (2010 - 2012)\nBirla Institute of Technology and Science\nB.E.(Hons.), Computer Science · (2006 - 2010)\n \nPage 5 of 5",
