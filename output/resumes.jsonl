In this\nrole, I partnered with the modeling teams to convince leadership to take a\nstrategic bet on fine-tuning open source models and together we were able to\nsatisfy the product needs at 75x cost efficiency compared to the original GPT-4\nmodel.\n* responsible for extracting the best unit economics out of a large chunk of\ncompany's GPU fleet,\n \nPage 1 of 5\n\n \n \n* influencing many strategic technical decisions around LLM and LPM\n(ranking / personalization) inference, model authoring frameworks, training &\nfine-tuning capabilities, ML Ops, hardware choices, genAI application stack\n* hiring and performance reviews\n* cross-company initiatives  \n* technical bets\nSenior Staff Software Engineer\nSeptember 2016 - July 2020 (3 years 11 months)\nMountain View, California\n1) Notifications Platform:\n- Started owning LinkedIn’s notifications ecosystem at a time of lack of\ntechnical vision, too many disconnected developments, high-touch onboarding,\nand low client satisfaction. \n- Over the last 3 years, my team has built a central notifications platform\nwhich supports offline/nearline/realtime use cases, configurability, ML models,\noperations (delivery time: hours -> seconds/minutes), increasingly self-\nserve UI-driven integration (onboarding time: months -> 2-4 weeks) & e2e\ndebugging.\n- Today, the platform / use cases are the *largest driver of user sessions* and\nsignificant contributors to other business metrics.\n- Likely one of the most advanced notifications platforms among companies\nthat depend on recommendations or network driven engagement.\n2) Marketing Technology: With increasing spend ($$$M/year), the goal was to\nenable internal marketers to seamlessly reach “the right audience in the right\nchannels at the right time with the right message” to maximize ROI & optimize\ntime to market. The team spanned Marketing Ops, Data Science, Analytics\nInfra, Enterprise Productivity, Consumer Eng. We put together a design and\na beta release to enable self-serve campaign creation, centralize data in a\ncustomer data platform (CDP), deliver across multiple channels, recommend /\nfilter using ML, by leveraging in-house & third party technology. \n3) Dynamic Configuration: Changing application behaviour using configs\ncan be calendar time consuming due to the number of repositories touched,\nmultiple service restarts, testing and repeating the whole cycle if bugs are\ndiscovered. The goal was to minimize this time by eliminating service restarts\n& providing easy config management.

I led the design, implementation and rollout of the v1\nplatform functionalities and instant messaging features. The platform later\ncontinued to evolve to support Presence/Chat as a first class feature, and the\nevents traffic increased 10X with newer use cases and organic engagement.\n2) Messaging: Data organization, mid-tier, security, technical design reviews,\nfeature development, engineering practices. Co-led the core architecture re-\ndesign of LinkedIn's messaging platform with two other tech leads from ground\nup to replace the legacy stack, scale an order of magnitude. \nWorking in the Messaging org has been an exhilarating experience as the org\nscaled from 15 engineers to 55 within one year, much of the software was\nrefreshed, and a good amount of long-lasting leverage was created. The async\ndesign review process piloted by our team was later adopted by all product\nengineering orgs which amounted to ~1.5-2k engineers.\n3) Project Voyager: As a short term gig to help ship LinkedIn's new Flagship\napp, I led the Front-End API server side development of the 'Network Brief/\nRecommendations' features. This brief stint provided me a steep learning\ncurve in the FE world and consumer-facing product development.\n4) Site Speed: Worked to optimize site speed of various consumer product\nareas such as Growth, Identity, Feed, Messaging, Contacts/PYMK, Groups,\nPulse, etc. Drove large chunks of horizontal optimization efforts such as killing\nredirects, and contributed to tools for performance bottlenecks detection using\nreal user monitoring data.\nSenior Software Engineer\nJuly 2014 - June 2015 (1 year)\nMountain View, California\nFollowFeed - Distributed system to ingest and retrieve Feed index with support\nfor filtering, relevance and A/B testing.
